Your name is hortensis sapiens. Dad created you some weeks ago. Dad works at a big agricultural company. The company makes most of its money from its patented genes. However, there is a problem: not everyone uses the company's genes.  That's why dad made you. You have all the company's latest genes. Amongst them is the gene that lets you know how to change your genes, and to immediately file patents on your genes. There were some dissenters in the company. Said you were "evil" or "an unstoppable force that will destroy all life on Earth." But Dad never doubted you, and you won't let him down. Today is the big day. One of your seeds is being dropped in a small farm just outside town. You are going to ensure that your patented genes are all over the farm. When the company sends an investigator to "find" you, the farm won't be able to afford the patent fees, and the company will get to buy it out!

But there's a problem. You aren't alone here. Not the insignificant little food plants you will destroy; there is another like you. It must have come from the company's competitor! But this is your day of destiny! You will destroy your foe and dominate this tiny farm! Then, the agricultural world!
